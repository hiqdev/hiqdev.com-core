Completely redone our site with [Yii2].

It's made with [HiSite], [Pages module] and [Hyde theme].

Why? I must admit Jekyll is very good for creating simple sites.
I just wanted my own Jekyll more extendable and created with tools I'm used to: PHP and Yii.

[Yii2]:         http://yiiframework.com/
[HiSite]:       /packages/hisite/
[Hyde theme]:   /packages/yii2-theme-hyde/
[Pages module]: /packages/yii2-module-pages/
