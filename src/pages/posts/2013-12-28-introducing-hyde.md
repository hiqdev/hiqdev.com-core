title: Introducing Hyde
---

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme
that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content.
It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective
foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
