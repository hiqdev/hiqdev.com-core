title: rEPPy became hEPPy

I had to turn rEPPy to hEPPy to register
it to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/heppy/).
Reppy was already taken. And hEPPy is nice and happy :)

[hEPPy](/heppy) is EPP client and library in Python.

[EPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol)
is Extensible Provisioning Protocol used for registrar-registry
communication to register and manage domains.

hEPPy is gradually approaching state when it's going to be usable.
