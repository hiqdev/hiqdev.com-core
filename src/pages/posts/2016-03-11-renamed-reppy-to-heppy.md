I had to turn rEPPy to hEPPy to register
it to [PyPI].<br>
Reppy was already taken. And hEPPy is nice and happy :)

[hEPPy] is EPP client and library in Python.

[EPP] is Extensible Provisioning Protocol used for registrar-registry
communication to register and manage domains.

hEPPy is gradually approaching state when it's going to be usable.

[hEPPy]:    /packages/heppy/
[EPP]:      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol
[PyPI]:     https://pypi.python.org/pypi/heppy/
